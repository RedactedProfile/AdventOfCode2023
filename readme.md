I'm planning to do Advent of Code 2023
I don't know if i'll be able to play along every day in lockstep with the rest of the community but I can at least participate as the days reveal themselves.

I don't even really know which language I wish to participate with yet. So at this point.. why not as many of them as I find interesting?
