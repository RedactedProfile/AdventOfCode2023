I'm planning to do Advent of Code 2023
I don't know if i'll be able to play along every day in lockstep with the rest of the community but I can at least participate as the days reveal themselves.

I don't even really know which language I wish to participate with yet. So at this point.. why not as many of them as I find interesting? 

-----

## Languages 

### C

I plan to use C this year, primarily because I've been working with the Quake 2 code base and it's peaked my interet. I do plan to use the modern dialect of C and through the visor of VisualC 

### C++ 

I want to continue honing my practice of C++, this has the highest contender of being my primary language this year. I will continue to use C++20 and making heavy use of the STL. 

### C# 

This is an interesting one because I don't actually plan to use normal C# .NET the way you'd think.  I plan to visually represent the puzzles using the MonoGame/XNA framework.  
I found myself several times last year desiring to visually see the puzzles construct itself. I think it'd be an interesting spin. 

### Rust 

I just started using Rust, and this would be an excellent excuse to really get familiar with the language and all it's quirks. 

### PHP 

For when I want an easy day.
